# hello-world
intro to github
hi all, just a regular guy learning this coding thing. i have tons of questions like; what is a hub? and why doi have to "git" it? hmmm... inquiring minds want to know. also, what is the golden mean? and why are they so angry? anyway, these are the things that keep me up at night. hopefully through coding I can get some clarity, "c" what I mean?
